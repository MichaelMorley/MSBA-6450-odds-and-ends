Here s one using the "boot" package
#The Standard Normal Bootstrap Confidence Interval
#Suppose that theta.hat is an estimator of theta, and assume the standard error of 
# the estimator is se(theta.hat).  If theta.hat is the sample mean and the sample size
#is big enough - we can invoke the Central Limit Theorem.
#Then Z = (theta.hat - E(theta.hat))/se(theta.hat)
#Hence, if theta.hat is an unbiased estimatoe for theta then an approximate
#100(1 - alpha)% confidence interval for theta.
#theta.hat +/- z(alpha/2)se(theta.hat)
library(boot)#To get boot and boot.ci
help(patch)#Let's check out the data in "patch" in the bootstrap package.
data(patch, package = "bootstrap")
data
theta.boot<- function(dat,ind){
  #Create a function to compute the statistic.
  y<- dat[ind,1]
  z<- dat[ind,2]
  mean(y)/mean(z)
  
}
#We will run a bootstrap and compute the C.I. for bioequivalence ratio.
y<- patch$y
z<- patch$z
dat<- cbind(y,z)
dat
boot.obj<- boot(dat, statistic = theta.boot, R= 2000)
print(boot.obj)

print(boot.ci(boot.obj, type =  c("basic", "norm", "perc", "bca")))#BCa is bias correct and accelerated.
#BCa is considered the best bootstaped C.I.  the "acceleration" has to do with the 
#skewness of the distribution and it is dealt with by a Jankknife proceedure inside the bootstrap itself!
#COOL!
